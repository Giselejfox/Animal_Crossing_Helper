ANIMAL CROSSING ISLAND BUG/FISH SWAP


- user needs to input a bug they've caught
- user input done to show space is full


- program needs to read files containing the bug and fish prices
- program needs to not ask if I want to swap anything out until my inventory is full
- program needs to determine if the fish/bug I just caught is worth more than anything in my inventory once my inventory is full
- need to be able to eliminate bugs or fish from the list of things I can swap out if I haven't donated them yet
